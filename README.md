ActionScript 3.0 Adjusting Gravity
dev: https://www.linkedin.com/in/efegunes/

This code adds gravity to projects which written with ActionScript 3.0
Since it is not used usually today, there are not many resources related to ActionScript.
Most of the resources in the forums are also about to the older version ActionScript 2.0.
For this reason, I believe this code I shared will be useful to developers.
